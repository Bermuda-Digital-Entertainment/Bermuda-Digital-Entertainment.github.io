# Gantt Chart

# Github Issues
We decided to use Github Issues over Trello, which was used by our predecessors Team 14, as we found their features to be very similar, our project was already stored in Github and this meant we did not have to sign up for and familiarise ourselves with a new service.

We created milestones for which each issue was assigned to. At first we started with week long sprints, but later decided that two-week sprints were more suitable for our team's working style.
